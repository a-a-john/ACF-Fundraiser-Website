This is a brief webpage showcasing our 2025 fundraiser for the Alberta Cancer Foundation.

Called Hope in Motion, we are a Calgary-based team of hospital volunteers passionate about making cancer journeys easier for Albertans, while raising funds for the Alberta Cancer Foundation.

If you'd like to donate to the Alberta Cancer Foundation in our name and help us reach our goal, please visit [https://fundraise.albertacancer.ca/campaign/2025-community-events/c651733](https://fundraise.albertacancer.ca/HopeInMotion).
