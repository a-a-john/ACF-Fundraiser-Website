# Hope in Motion – ACF Fundraiser Website

This repository contains the website for our 2025 fundraiser, **Hope in Motion**, in support of the **Alberta Cancer Foundation (ACF)**.  

We’re a self-run, Calgary-based team of hospital volunteers passionate about making cancer journeys easier for Albertans, and raising funds for cancer research, care, and support programs while aiming to run 15,000 km!
